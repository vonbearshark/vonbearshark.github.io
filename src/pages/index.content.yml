    description: >-
      Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) are federal contractors in charge
      of coordinating the recovery of transplantable organs from medically
      eligible organ donors in their region. An astounding lack of
      accountability and oversight in the nationâ€™s creaking, monopolistic organ
      transplant system is allowing hundreds of thousands of potential organ
      donations to fall through the cracks. Patients of color are less likely to
      receive organ transplants than white patients because of inferior OPO
      service.


      This site, developed with Bloom, visualizes OPO performance as a tool for advocating for improvement.
