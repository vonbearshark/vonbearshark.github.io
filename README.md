My personal website, written in Gatsby and deployed on Netlify

---

Install (with `node` and `npm` installed): `npm ci`

Dev: `npm start`
Dev CMS (in another terminal, may require install): `npx netlify-cms-proxy-server`

Prod: `npm run build && npm run serve`

Netlify will automatically pick up `main` on changes and deploy it
